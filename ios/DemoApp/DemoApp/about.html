    <h1>About the Demo</h1>
    <p>
        This app demonstrates the use of the Radar SDK for iOS from Cedexis.
        It allows an app developer to incorporate real user monitoring into
        their app, as well as to generate global network performance
        data, which is used to generate real time logic-based load-balancing
        by Cedexis Openmix.
